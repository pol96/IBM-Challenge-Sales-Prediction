# IBM-Challenge-Sales-Prediction
During IBM company presentation we were required to develop a sales forecasting analysis 
  -data preparation and compute lags/trends over time for total items sold shop by shop
    -data: considering all russian shops for a company
    -dates: dayly sellings of items, prices of items sold for a period of 33 months
  -lightGBM. we figured out that lightGBM and XGBoost could possibly be the best models due to lack of computational power and high 
  performances guaranteed. in this Notebook we implemented a very basic hyperparameter tuning still due to lack of computational 
  power
  -results yield to a good prediction for month 33
